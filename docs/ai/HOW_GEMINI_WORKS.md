# How Gemini AI Recommendations Work

## Overview

The AI recommendation system uses **Gemini 2.0 Flash** to analyze user behavior and provide intelligent product recommendations. Here's exactly what data it receives and how it calculates recommendations.

---

## Data Flow

```
User Request → Fetch User Dashboard → Extract Context → Build Prompt → Gemini AI → Parse Response → Return 4 Products
```

---

## 1. Input Data Sources

### A. User Dashboard API Call
```
GET https://wb16fax93g.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dev/users/{user_id}/dashboard
```

This returns:
```json
{
  "cart": {
    "items": [
      {
        "productId": "abc-123",
        "name": "Classic Margherita Pizza",
        "category": "Pizza",
        "quantity": 2,
        "price": 250
      }
    ],
    "totalItems": 2
  },
  "likedProducts": {
    "products": [
      {
        "productId": "def-456",
        "productName": "Pepperoni Pizza"
      }
    ],
    "totalLiked": 1
  },
  "allProducts": [
    {
      "products_id": "xyz-789",
      "name": "BBQ Chicken Pizza",
      "category": "Pizza",
      "price": 340,
      "description": "Pizza with BBQ sauce...",
      "imageUrl": "https://...",
      "sizes": ["Small", "Medium", "Large"]
    },
    // ... all other products
  ]
}
```

---

## 2. Context Extraction

The system extracts and organizes this data:

### Cart Items
```python
cart_items = [
    {
        'id': 'abc-123',
        'name': 'Classic Margherita Pizza',
        'category': 'Pizza',
        'quantity': 2
    }
]
```

### Liked Items
```python
liked_items = [
    {
        'id': 'def-456',
        'name': 'Pepperoni Pizza'
    }
]
```

### All Available Products
```python
all_products = [
    {
        'products_id': 'xyz-789',
        'name': 'BBQ Chicken Pizza',
        'category': 'Pizza',
        'price': 340,
        'description': '...',
        'imageUrl': '...',
        'sizes': [...]
    },
    // ... all products in the store
]
```

### Products by Category
```python
products_by_category = {
    'Pizza': [product1, product2, ...],
    'Burger': [product3, product4, ...],
    'Fries': [product5, product6, ...],
    // ... grouped by category
}
```

## 3. Gemini Prompt Construction

The system builds a detailed prompt for Gemini AI:

### Example Prompt Sent to Gemini:

```
You are an AI product recommendation assistant for an e-commerce shoe store.
Based on the user's shopping behavior, recommend EXACTLY 4 products that would interest them.

Items currently in user's cart:
  - Classic Margherita Pizza (Pizza) - Quantity: 2
  - Garlic Bread (Sides) - Quantity: 1

Products the user has liked:
  - Pepperoni Pizza
  - Truffle Fries

Available products in the store:
  - ID: cb88b8d5-9772-4775-b46f-5ce2c0d75158, Name: Meat Lovers Pizza, Category: Pizza, Price: ₹360
  - ID: 5d693358-14c2-4b77-960a-c637ac1d39b1, Name: BBQ Chicken Pizza, Category: Pizza, Price: ₹340
  - ID: ba51a32b-32ba-4b10-858c-ac81b6ee494b, Name: Spicy Chicken Burger, Category: Burger, Price: ₹165
  - ID: 6d26383f-ecf2-40cc-9109-8bce847eabde, Name: Garlic Parmesan Fries, Category: Fries, Price: ₹110
  - ID: ff317672-b493-49ed-86c6-d87c1e808ecd, Name: Truffle Fries, Category: Fries, Price: ₹150
  ... (all products listed)

Based on this information, recommend EXACTLY 4 products by their product IDs.
Do not recommend products already in the cart or liked list.
Consider category preferences and complementary products.
Return ONLY the 4 product IDs, one per line, nothing else.
```

## 4. How Gemini Calculates Recommendations

Gemini AI analyzes the prompt using its large language model to:

### A. Pattern Recognition
- **Category Affinity**: User has Pizza in cart → likely interested in more Pizza or complementary items
- **Price Sensitivity**: User buying ₹250-340 items → recommend similar price range
- **Complementary Products**: Pizza + Fries/Burger = common meal combinations

### B. Behavioral Analysis
- **Cart Items**: Strong signal of current intent
  - User has Pizza → recommend sides (Fries, Drinks)
  - User has Burger → recommend Fries, Drinks
- **Liked Items**: Indicates preferences but not immediate purchase intent
  - User liked Pepperoni Pizza → recommend similar pizzas or upgrades

### C. Exclusion Logic
- Excludes products already in cart
- Excludes products already liked
- Ensures variety in recommendations

### D. Complementary Logic
Gemini understands common product pairings:
- Pizza → Fries, Garlic Bread, Drinks
- Burger → Fries, Onion Rings, Drinks
- Fries → Dips, Drinks

### E. Diversity
- Recommends from multiple categories
- Balances premium and affordable options
- Considers upselling opportunities

## 5. Gemini Response

Gemini returns product IDs:
```
6d26383f-ecf2-40cc-9109-8bce847eabde
ff317672-b493-49ed-86c6-d87c1e808ecd
ba51a32b-32ba-4b10-858c-ac81b6ee494b
13eddb74-5020-4838-a5bd-1f6760042ec9
```

---

## 6. Response Parsing

The system:
1. Extracts product IDs from Gemini's response
2. Maps IDs to full product objects
3. Ensures exactly 4 recommendations
4. Falls back to rule-based if needed

### Code Logic:
```python
# Parse product IDs from response
recommended_ids = []
for line in response_text.split('\n'):
    line = line.strip()
    for product in context['all_products']:
        if product['products_id'] in line:
            if product['products_id'] not in recommended_ids:
                recommended_ids.append(product['products_id'])
            break

# Ensure exactly 4 recommendations
if len(recommended_ids) < 4:
    # Fill with rule-based recommendations
    fallback_recs = generate_fallback_recommendations(context, 4)
    for rec in fallback_recs:
        if rec['products_id'] not in recommended_ids:
            recommended_ids.append(rec['products_id'])
            if len(recommended_ids) >= 4:
                break

# Limit to exactly 4
recommended_ids = recommended_ids[:4]
```

---

## 7. Final Response

```json
{
    "model_used": "gemini-ai",
    "recommendation_count": 4,
    "recommendations": [
        {
            "product_id": "6d26383f-ecf2-40cc-9109-8bce847eabde",
            "name": "Garlic Parmesan Fries",
            "category": "Fries",
            "price": 110,
            "description": "Fries tossed with garlic and parmesan",
            "image_url": "https://...",
            "sizes": []
        },
        // ... 3 more products
    ],
    "user_context": {
        "cart_items_count": 2,
        "liked_items_count": 1,
        "cart_items": [...],
        "liked_items": [...]
    },
    "user_id": "test-user-123"
}
```

## 8. Why Gemini is Better Than Rule-Based

### Rule-Based Approach (Fallback)
```python
# Simple logic:
1. Recommend from same categories as cart items
2. Recommend from same categories as liked items
3. Recommend highest-priced items
```

**Limitations:**
- No understanding of complementary products
- No meal pairing logic
- No context awareness
- Rigid category matching

### Gemini AI Approach
```
✅ Understands meal combinations (Pizza + Fries)
✅ Recognizes upselling opportunities
✅ Considers price sensitivity
✅ Balances variety and relevance
✅ Learns from patterns in the prompt
✅ Adapts to different user behaviors
```

## 9. Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User with Pizza in Cart
**Input:**
- Cart: Classic Margherita Pizza (₹250)
- Liked: None

**Gemini's Logic:**
1. User buying pizza → recommend sides
2. Price point ₹250 → recommend ₹100-150 sides
3. Common pairings → Fries, Garlic Bread

**Output:**
- Garlic Parmesan Fries (₹110)
- Truffle Fries (₹150)
- Garlic Bread (₹80)
- Mozzarella Sticks (₹120)

### Scenario 2: User with Burger in Cart
**Input:**
- Cart: Bacon Burger (₹175)
- Liked: Spicy Chicken Burger

**Gemini's Logic:**
1. User likes burgers → recommend premium burgers
2. Already has burger → recommend sides
3. Liked spicy → consider spicy options

**Output:**
- Loaded Cheese Fries (₹120)
- Onion Rings (₹90)
- Spicy Wings (₹180)
- Jalapeño Poppers (₹110)

### Scenario 3: Empty Cart, Multiple Likes
**Input:**
- Cart: Empty
- Liked: Pepperoni Pizza, BBQ Chicken Pizza, Meat Lovers Pizza

**Gemini's Logic:**
1. Strong pizza preference → recommend premium pizzas
2. Likes variety → recommend different pizza types
3. No cart → focus on converting likes to purchases

**Output:**
- Four Cheese Pizza (₹330)
- Veggie Supreme Pizza (₹310)
- Hawaiian Pizza (₹300)
- Truffle Mushroom Pizza (₹380)
